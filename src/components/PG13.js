                                    On every videogame disc package, there is a rating that shows the ESRB rating
                                    (E for Everyone, PG for Parental Guidance, PG-13 for Parental Guidance under 13,
                                    and M for Mature). As a child growing up, the founder YSL really liked
                                    PG-13 because it demonstrated a nuance that regulation is necessary but
                                    individuals can earn autonomy. We believe the regulatory guidelines that
                                    are meant to "protect the small investors" are oftentimes degrading and
                                    counter-effective. So our philosophy is PG-13 to promote nuanced changes
                                    to securities regulation.

                                <p>We hope to change the meaning of investing. We want to see a world where investments stay in a company longer to allow time for a company to grow! We want to reduce the number of trades that go in and out of 100 companies in a day. Under the blockchain system, everyone will be able to see what others have. Investors will be able to trade 24/7. Finally, everyone in the world will be able to invest.</p>
